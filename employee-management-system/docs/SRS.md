# SRS - Employee Management System

## 1. Project Overview
This application is used to manage employee records in a company.  
It allows us to add new employees, view the list of employees, update employee details, and delete an employee if required..

The backend is built using Spring Boot, and data is stored in MySQL database.  
The frontend (React) communicates with this backend using REST API calls.

## 2. Objectives
- Store employee details in database
- Allow CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Provide simple and clean API for frontend
- Ensure smooth connection between frontend and backend
